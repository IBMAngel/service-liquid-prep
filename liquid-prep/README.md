# Liquid Prep Express

Our goal is to integrate Liquid Prep App with Open Horizon.  We have brought over the frontend from https://github.com/Liquid-Prep/LiquidPrep-App and created an express server backend with Dockerfiles for the supported platforms.   This enables containerization of Liquid Prep App as a service for edge computing.  

# Benefits:
